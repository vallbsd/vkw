Simple Firefox addon that makes vkvideo player wider.
Just click on icon, and right side panel goes away.
Second click gives it back.

Since addon does not consist any signature, use this Firefox hint (though this
only works in esr, dev and nightly):
  xpinstall.signatures.required=false

Then pack all files to vkw.zip and install.
